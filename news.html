o	The report comprise or consist five chapters, the first chapter contains the aim of SIWES programmed, exercises, the history background of the organization. The second gives the detail of action acquired. The last comprise recommendation, summary and conclusion of SIWES Report.

 
<h2> CHAPTER ONE</h2> <br> <br>
<h2>1.1 INTRODUCTION OF SIWES </h2> <br>
The concept behind industrial training is to acquire practical knowledge in addition to what has been learn in the institution.
The four mandatory supervised industrial attachments, is a program institute impose by the federal government to help students acquired different technical skill.
<h2>1.2 BACKGROUND OF SIWES</h2> <br>
Its aims by ensuring student to the practical and the actualization of working situation which may meet after graduation and it’s learning is mainly expected to produce graduated qualifications to meet man power of employment of Industrial Training Fund  (ITF), there was growing concern Among the industrialist that, graduate of higher learning have good background, such as student for opinion that theoretical education going to higher institution was responsive enough to meet the need of employers of  labor as a requirement or national board for technical education.
<h2>1.3 Brief history of SIWES</h2> <br>
The students’ industrial work experience scheme (SIWES) was introduced in the year 1973 by the industrial training for the establishment of the scheme and was necessitated by the law performance of graduate after school in some of the labor market. In the Federal government Decree no 47 of 8th October, 1971 which was amended in1990 constitution, highlighted the capacity building of human resources in industry, the government impose people through training and retraining of workers in other to provide much more need of Goods and services.
The SIWES program upon its establishment has become a pre-requisite for the award of diploma [NATIONAL AND ORDINARY and degrees certificate which are [FIRST CLASS, SECOND CLASS UPPER, SECOND CLASS LOWER, THRID CLASS AND PASS.
In most institution nationwide, offer courses under SIWES provision.
The use of SIWES are pre-requisite for the award of degree and diploma results in the pro-efficiency of the scheme overtime as participant in the course which has been understanding in the labor market owing to experience and archived during their program.
The ITF was established by the federal government during military regime, the organization was created during the event of second National development plan period 1970-1974) by the Late General Murtala Mohammed.
The ITF allocated its office headquarter after been created in Plateau state of which it has its branches in all the other states capitals of the national federation. 
The organizations also form Schematic Duration for every institution such as; Colleges, poly techniques, and universities, of which it vary by some additional month.
<h2>1.4 AIM AND OBJECTIVE OF SIWES</h2> <br>
•	One of the objective of SIWES program is that, they promote skill acquisition in industries and commerce with a view of generating indigenous trained man power sufficient to meet Nigerian economy
•	To enable student to learn difference way (STRATEGY) to make good relationship with employer and co employers on the graduation.
•	It imposes the students to learned proper method in handling equipment and some electronic devices.
•	It makes a way for the students to improve his or her ability effort to contribute in the growths of the nation.
•	The other objective of the SIWES It makes student to realize and consider related activities which are to be face after graduation.
<h2>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF SIWES  </h2> <br>
	The basic significance of Student Industrial Work Experience Scheme Training is to help students of a high institution with different methodologies and practical ways that helps one to put on what he study or learned in a good practical way.
	The STUDENT Industrial Work Experience Scheme helps students to know how one will be able to rely on his own performance and how your feature we are to be build after undergoing into graduate.
	It also helps students to involve on an act of relationship between organization owner (employee) and the student. 
<h2>1.6 BRIEF HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF ORGANISATION </h2> <br>
IBSONKA ENERGY RESOURCES CENTER GOMBE was and organization established by Engr. Ibrahim Ahmad Kawu by the year 2013.
The workshop center is located at Yerwagana Behind mega station Gombe, Gombe state.
The workshop center was basically established for the purpose of Repairing Modern electronics Device, Maintenance of Digital electronics selling and supplying of different machines such as printers, desktops, laptops, solars and any other electronics equipment

<h2>1.8 SAFETY PRECAUTIONS IN ORGANISATIONAL WORKSHOP.</h2> <br>
Safety precautions refers to the process of protecting your life, machine and the machine workings tools, and by the means of protecting material from getting damage
Some safety precautions are:


<h2>CHAPTER TWO <br> <br>
2.0 INTRODUCTION to Computer</h2>	
 <br>
Figure 1
A computer system has three main components: hardware, Software, and people. The equipment associated with a Computer system is called hardware. 
 Software is a set of Instructions that tells the hardware what to do. People, however, are the most important component of a computer System – people use the power of the computer for some Purpose.	Software is actually a computer program. To be more specific,
 A program is a set of step-by-step instructions that directs the Computer to do the tasks you want it to do and to produce the Results you want.
 Computer is a machine that has power to make changes. A computer is a machine that can be programmed to accept Data (input), process it into useful information (output), and Store it away (in a secondary storage device) for safekeeping Or later reuse. The processing of input to output is directed by the software but performed by the hardware. 
To function, a computer system requires four main aspects of Data handling: input, processing, output, and storage.
 The Hardware responsible for these four areas operates as follows: Input devices accept data in a form that the computer can Use; they then send the data to the processing unit. The processor, more formally known as the central processing Unit (CPU), has the electronic circuitry that manipulates input Data into the information people want. The central processing Unit executes computer instructions that are specified in the Program.
 <br>
Output devices show people the processed data-information in a form that they can use. Storage usually means secondary storage.
 Secondary storage consists of devices, such as diskettes, which can store data and programs outside the computer itself. These devices supplement the computer’s memory, which, as we will see, can hold data and programs only temporarily.
 Your secondary storage Device in this case is a diskette, a magnetic medium that Stores the essay until it is needed again. Some hardware needed for Input, processing, output, and storage. These same Components make up all computer systems, whether small, medium, or large Input: What Goes In Input is the data that you put into the computer system for Processing. 
 <br>
Figure 3
Some common ways of feeding input Data into the system: Typing on a keyboard. Computer keyboards operate in much the same way as electric typewriter keyboards. The computer Responds to what you enter; that is, it “echoes” what you type by displaying it on the screen in front of you. Pointing with mouse. 
A mouse is a device that is moved by Hand over a flat surface. As the ball on its underside rotates, the mouse movement causes corresponding movement of a Pointer on the computer screen. Pressing buttons on the Mouse lets you invoke commands. Scanning with a flatbed scanner, wand reader or bar code Reader (Figure 3). Flatbed scanners act like a copying machine by using light beams to scan a document or picture that is laid upon its glass face. A great way to send pictures through Email! Bar scanners, which you have seen in retail stores, use Laser beams to read special letters, numbers, or symbols such As the zebra-striped bar codes on many products. You can input data to a computer in many other interesting Ways, including writing, speaking, pointing, or even by just Looking at the data. We will examine all these in detail in a later chapter. The Processor and Memory: Data Manipulation In a computer the processor is the center of activity. The Processor, as we noted, is also called the central processing Unit (CPU). The central processing unit consists of electronic Circuits that interpret and execute program instructions, as well As communicate with the input, output, and storage devices. It is the central processing unit that actually transforms data into information. Data is the raw material to be processed by a Computer. Such material can be letters, numbers, or facts like Grades in a class, baseball batting averages, or light and dark Areas in a photograph. Processed data becomes information Data that is organized, meaningful, and useful. In school, for Instance, an instructor could enter various student grades (data), which can be processed to produce final grades and perhaps a class average (information). Data that is perhaps Uninteresting on its own may become very interesting once it is converted to information. The raw facts (data) about your Finances, such as a paycheck or a donation to charity or a Medical bill may not be captivating individually, but together, These and other acts can be processed to produce the refund Or amount you owe on your income tax return (information). Computer memory, also known as primary storage, is closely associated with the central processing unit but separate from It. Memory holds the data after it is input to the system and before it is processed; also, memory holds the data after it has been processed but before it has been released to the output Device. In addition, memory holds the programs (computer Instructions) needed by the central processing unit. Output: What Comes out Output, the result produced by the central processing unit, is a Computer’s whole reason for being. Output is usable Information; that is, raw input data that has been processed by the computer into information. The most common forms of Output are words, numbers, and graphics. Word output, for Example, may be the letters and memos prepared by office People using word processing software. Other workers may be more interested in numbers, such as those found in formulas, Schedules, and budgets. In many cases numbers can be understood more easily when output in the form of charts and Graphics. The most common output devices are computer screens (Figure 3) and printers (Figure 4).
<br>
Figure 4
Screens can vary in their Forms of display, producing text, numbers, symbols, art, Photographs, and even video-in full color. Printers produce Printed reports as instructed by a computer program, often in Full color. You can produce output from a computer in other ways, Including film and voice output. We will examine all output Methods in detail in a later chapter. Secondary Storage Secondary storage provides additional storage separate from Memory. Secondary storage has several advantages. For Instance, it would be unwise for a college registrar to try to Keep the grades of all the students in the college in the Computer’s memory; if this were done, the computer would Probably not have room to store anything else. Also, memory Holds data and programs only temporarily. Secondary storage is needed for large volumes of data and also for data that Must persist after the computer is turned off. The two most common secondary storage mediums are Magnetic disk and magnetic tape.
  
Figure 5
 
 A magnetic disk can be a Diskette or a hard disk. A diskette is usually 3-1/2 inches in Diameter (in some rare cases older disks are 5-1/4 inches). A Diskette is removable so you can take your data with you. Hard Disks, shown in Figure 5, have more storage capacity than Diskettes and also offer faster access to the data they hold. Hard disks are often contained in disk packs shown in Figure 6 That are built into the computer so your data stays with the Computer. Disk data is read by disk drives. Personal computer Disk drives read diskettes; most personal computers also have Hard disk drives. Modern personal computers are starting to come with removable storage media, like Zip disks. These Disks are slightly larger than a diskette and can be inserted and removed like a diskette, but hold much more data than a Diskette and are faster for the CPU to access than a diskette. Most modern computers also come with a CD-ROM drive. A CD is an optical disk; it uses a laser beam to read the disk. CD’s are removable and store large volumes of data relatively inexpensively. Some CD drives are read only memory (ROM), which means that your computer can read programs, from CD’s, but you cannot save data to the CD yourself. The hardware devices attached to the computer are called Peripheral equipment. 
 
Figure 6
Peripheral equipment includes all input, Output, and secondary storage devices. In the case of personal Computers, some of the input, output, and storage devices are built into the same physical unit. In many personal computers, The CPU and disk drive are all contained in the same housing; the keyboard, mouse, and screen are separate. In larger computer systems, however, the input, processing, Output, and storage functions may be in separate rooms, Separate buildings, or even separate countries. For example, Data may be input on terminals at a branch bank and then Transmitted to the central processing unit at the headquarters Bank. The information produced by the central processing unit May then be transmitted to the international offices, where it Is printed out. Meanwhile, disks with stored data may be kept in bank headquarters and duplicate data kept on disk or tape In a warehouse across town for safekeeping. Although the equipment may vary widely, from the simplest Computer to the most powerful, by and large the four Elements of a computer system remain the same: input, Processing, output, and storage. Now let us look at the way Computers have been traditionally classified.

<h2> COMPUTER HARDWARE</h2>
Hardware is best described As any physical component of a computer system Containing a circuit board, ICs , or other Electronics. A perfect example of hardware is the Screen on which you are viewing this page. Whether it be a monitor, tablet, or smartphone, it Is hardware. Without any hardware, your computer would not exist, and software could not be used. Hardware is a broad term that refers to all the physical parts that make up a computer. The internal hardware devices that Make up the computer and ensure that it is functional are Called components, while external hardware devices that are not essential to a computer’s functions are called peripherals. The most important component of a computer’s internal Hardware is certainly the motherboard, which powers and Controls the whole system. Hardware is the set of physical and the material
Components that compounded or added to any electronic Devices such as computers, smart phones, eBooks, Wearable’s, televisions, music players, robots or space Probes among other examples. In the field of computer and electronics hardware and the Software is the basic element that makes a device, Mechanism or electronic machine to perform a series of Tasks automatically, the hardware is the physical part while the software is the intangible part, the hardware is The body and software is the soul. When opening any computer we can see how a set of Electrical, electronic and mechanical components are Assembled and interconnected, cables, chips, switches, Fans, hard drives, graphics cards… All these elements that We can see and touch represents the hardware of the Computer, on the other hand any electronic device that we Connect to the computer as a keyboard, monitor, memory Card or a mouse in turn is composed of hardware inside This being considered as part of computer when Connected itself. Hardware classification:  Internal hardware and External hardware. 
Internal hardware examples below is a list of internal hardware or hardware Found inside a computer. CPU (central processing unit), Drive (e.g., Blu-ray, CD-ROM, DVD, floppy drive, hard drive, and SSD). Fan (heat sink) Modem Motherboard Network card Power supply RAM Sound card Video card External hardware examples below is a list of external hardware or hardware Found outside a computer. Flat-panel, monitor, and LCD Gamepad Joystick Keyboard Microphone Mouse Printer Projector Scanner Speakers USB thumb drive

 Motherboards
The most important part of any computer is the motherboard. As the name implies a motherboard is the mother of all other Components in a computer. The motherboard brings all the core components together Such as: the Central Processing Unit (CPU), Memory and Hard Disks. In short, the motherboard connects and allows all of the components in the computer to work together. 
There are two different types of Motherboard: AT style and ATX style. The AT-style motherboards represent the classic approach to Component placement. AT-motherboards are available in two Variations, the baby AT and the full AT.

<br>
<h2>2.2 HOW TO IDENTIFY AT MOTHERBOARD</h2>
<br>
Step1.To identify an AT motherboard first check the power Connectors.

Step2.  AT Motherboards use two sets of 6-pin inline Power connectors Caution it is possible to plug these connectors in the wrong Order and fuse the motherboard. Most modern computers contain an ATX motherboard. ATX Boards can use Advanced Power Management. 
<br>
<h2>2.3 BRIDGES</h2>
<br>
 There are two main bridges on a motherboard the Northbridge and the Southbridge.<br>
The Northbridge, also known as the Memory Controller Hub (MCH), is traditionally one of the two chips in the core logic Chipset on a PC motherboard. 
<b>HOW NORTH BRIDGES FUNCTION</b>
<br>
1. Bridges control access to the processor from the peripherals. 
2. The Northbridge typically Controls communications between the CPU, RAM, AGP or PCI Express, and the Southbridge. 
3. A Northbridge will typically Work with only one or two classes of CPUs and generally only One type of RAM. There are a few chipsets that support two Types of RAM (generally these are available when there is a Shift to a new standard). 
The Southbridge
<br>
 Also known as the I/O Controller Hub (ICH), Is a chip that implements the “slower” capabilities of the Motherboard in a Northbridge Southbridge chipset computer Architecture. The Southbridge can usually be distinguished From the Northbridge by not being directly connected to the CPU. Rather, the Northbridge ties the Southbridge to the CPU. The functionality found on a contemporary Southbridge Includes:PCI bus, ISA bus, SMBus, DMA controller, Interrupt Controller, IDE, (SATA or PATA) controller ,LPC Bridge, Real Time Clock, Power management (APM and ACPI) and Nonvolatile BIOS memory BIOS Chips 
 <br>
 <h2>2.4 BASIC Input Output System</h2>
<br>
 BIOS refers to the software Code run by a computer when first powered on. 
<br>
  Function of BIOS 
<br>
  1. is to prepare the machine so other software Programs stored on various media (such as hard drives, Floppies, and CDs) can load, execute, and assume control of The computer. This process is known as booting up. 
2. The BIOS is stored as a ROM (Read-Only Memory) program And is retained when the machine is turned off. Settings within The BIOS may be changed by the user and these changes are Stored in the BIOS memory this is maintained by a trickle of Charge from the BIOS battery. Memory SIMMS- Single Inline Memory Modules. 
Motherboard Slots 
To add more functionality to a computer, cards such as Network or video cards can be added. Sometimes those functions are built into the motherboard. 
There are several Types of expansion slots: 
1. The PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) The PCI bus is Common in modern PCs, where it has displaced ISA as the Standard expansion bus, but it also appears in many other Computer types.
2. The Accelerated Graphics Port (also called Advanced Graphics Port) is a high-speed point-to-point channel for attaching a Graphics card to a computer’s motherboard, primarily to assist In the acceleration of 3D computer graphics. 
Peripheral Connections There are a number of ports on the motherboard for the Connection of additional devices:
 Serial ports connected the computer to devices such as Terminals or modems. Mice, keyboards, and other peripheral Devices also connected in this way. 
Parallel ports are most often used to communicate with Peripheral devices. The most common kind of parallel port is a Printer port, such as a Getronics connector based port which Transfers eight bits at a time.
 Disk drives are also connected via special parallel ports, such as those used by the SCSI and ATA technologies.

<h2>CHAPTER 4 <br>
4.1 REFERENCE DESIGNATOR</h2><br>
Definition <br>
 A Reference designator is used to identify a Component within an electrical schematic or on a Printed circuit board (PCB). It consists of one or two letters followed by numbers (e.g., C15, D10, J5, and R18). Each location on a PCB will have unique reference designators and there are distinct symbols for different types of electronic. All reference designators appear on the surface Layers of a PCB on the silkscreen layers (top and Bottom overlay).  Or 
<br>
 The reference designator for a Component is a letter and number combination Assigned to a specific component. Each Component gets its own reference designator, Meaning reference designators are never Repeated. The reference designator for a specific Component can be seen in your schematic design Documents, PCB layout, and bill of materials as You create the database for your design. In reference designator It breaks down a system into units, and then any number of sub-assemblies.
I have learned that the unit is the highest level of demarcation in a system and is always a numeral. The Subsequent demarcations are called assemblies and always have the Class Letter "A" as a prefix following by a sequential number starting with 1. Any number of sub-assemblies may be defined until finally reaching the component.
Class designation 'A' is for separable assemblies and class designation 'U' is for inseparable assemblies. <br>
I have learned that Inseparable assemblies (i.e., "items which are ordinarily replaced as a single item of supply"). <br>
EXAMPLES of designators commonly used on PCB are mention in the FIGURE below. <br>

BACKLIGHT INVERTER/CCFL <br>
<h2>4.2 INTRODUCTION TO BACKLIGHT INVERTER</h2> <br>
A backlight is a form of illumination used in liquid crystal displays (LCDs). As LCDs do not produce light by themselves—unlike, for example, cathode ray tube (CRT) displays—they need illumination (ambient light or a special light source) to produce a visible image.
 Backlights illuminate the LCD from the side or back of the display panel, unlike front lights, which are placed in front of the LCD. Backlights are used in small displays to increase readability in low light conditions such as in wristwatches, smart phones, computer displays and LCD televisions to produce light in a manner similar to a CRT display .

  <br>
Figure 17
<br>
LED backlights
<br>
 LCD/LED
 <br>
LED backlighting in color screens comes in two varieties: white LED backlights and RGB LED backlights. <br>
 White LEDs are used most often in notebooks and desktop screens, and make up virtually all mobile LCD screens. A white LED is typically a blue LED with broad spectrum yellow phosphor to result in the emission of white light. However, because the spectral curve peaks at yellow, it is a poor match to the transmission peaks of the red and green color filters of the LCD

<h2>4.3 BACKLIGHT INVERTER MAINTENANCE</h2><br>
•	Step 1:  Unplug the AC adapter and remove the battery. <br>
<br>
•	Step 2:  remove the LCD screen bezel  In order to access the inverter board. On most laptops screws are hidden behind screw seals.
<br>
•	Step3:  Carefully remove the seals with a sharp object and glue them on the LCD bezel, and Remove all screws and mark them for not to confused when you assemble the notebook back.
<br>	 
Figure 19 <br>
•	Some laptops also have screws on the side of the display. On the above laptop has 3 screws on each side. 
 <br>
Figure 20 <br>
•	Step 4: Start removing the LCD bezel with all fingers. Carefully wiggle the bezel to release plastic latches.  Sharp object should not use during disassemble because it can accidentally damage the screen.
<br>
•	 
Figure 21 <br>
•	Step 5: use a guitar pick to unlock them iIf latches are very tight. Insert the guitar pick between the LCD bezel and cover and carefully move it alone the side.

<h2>4.4 BLUE SCREEN  <br>
INTRODUCTION TO BLUESCREEN </h2> <br>
  	Blue screen is an error screens that windows operating system displays in the event of a fatal system error. It indicates a system crash, in which the operating system has reached a critical condition where it can no longer operate safely, e.g., hardware failure or a unexpected termination of a crucial process.
Another name for bluescreen are: <br>
•	Stop error <br>
•	Exception error <br>
•	Blue screen error <br>
<h2>4.5 WHY BLUE DEAD SCREEN OCCUR</h2> <br>
•	Faulty or poorly written device drivers <br>
<br>
•	Problems that occur with incompatible versions of DLL s: when Windows loads DLLs into memory shows that, the OS is in need of some applications programs .If versions are changed, the next time an application loads the DLL it may be different from what the application expects. These incompatibilities increase over time as more new software is installed, and is one of the main reasons why a freshly installed copy of Windows is more stable than an "old" one.
•	Hardware incompatibilities <br>
<br>
•	On Windows 10, a Blue Screen of Death (BSoD)  which  known as "blue screen," "stop error," or "system crash" — will always happen after a critical error occurs, which the system is not able to handle and resolve automatically.
<br>
•	I have learned that blue screen error occurs during the upgrade process of Windows 10, when startup, or randomly when actively using your laptop or desktop. The most frustrating part of all is that you'll only see a solid blue background and a sad character face without enough valuable information to determine the real cause of the problem.
<br>
•	Some hint message error display due to (BSoD) are The screen will output a, such as "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info, and then we'll restart for you." Or general stop error codes (such as VIDEO_TDR_TIMEOUT_DETECTED, PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGE_AREA, CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED, SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION, DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION, or IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL). Or hexadecimal codes (such as 0x000000D1, 0x0000000A, or 0x0000007B), but they're just hieroglyphics for most users
<br>
<h2>4.6 HOW TO REPAIR BLUE DEAD SCREEN (BSoD) USING SYSTEM RESTORE METHOD. </h2> <br>
System Restore point is a legacy feature that allows you to undo system changes without affecting your files to return the device to a previous point in time when Windows 10 was working correctly. System restore can be use as restorer point to fix the stop error.
On Windows 10, there are at least two ways to access System Restore. <br>
1.  Advanced startup, including through the boot potion menu or <br>
2.  USB installation media. <br>
<h2>4.7 ADVANCED STARTUP ACCESS FROM BOOT</h2><br>
Steps to launch and access advanced startup settings are: <br>
Step 1: the computer should start. <br>
Step 2: As soon as the Windows logo appears on your screen, press and hold the power button to interrupt the boot sequence.
<br>
Step 3: steps No. 1 and 2 should be Repeated two or more times. <br>
After the third interruption, Windows 10 should open the Advanced startup environment, and it can be can continue with the steps suggested in figure  to access System Restore.
 <br>
Figure 26 <br>
Advanced startup access from USB <br>
I have learned that Windows 10 installation media can be use to open the advanced startup using such steps: <br>
By Starting computer using a USB media <br>
NOTE: If device isn't starting from USB, you'll need to change your system's BIOS settings by ensuring that it can boot from USB. The BIOS can usually  access  by powering up the device and pressing one of the functions, Delete, or ESC keys, but  different computer manufacturers has different BIOS  functions key such as:
1.	Click the Next button. <br>
<br>
2.	Click the Repair your computer option from the bottom-left corner. <br>
 <br>
Figure 27
<br>
Once the step is complete, continue with the Restore Point instructions below. <br>
Select Restore Point to fix bug check <br>
To use a Restore Point to fix blue screen problems, such steps should be use: <br>
1.	Click the Advanced Startup option. <br>
Quick note: If you're accessing Advanced Startup from a USB media, you'll see the Troubleshoot option instead (see step No.2).
2.	Click the Troubleshoot option. <br>

3.	Click the Advanced options button. (This is step is not part of the process when using a USB media.) <br>
 
Figure 28 <br>
4.	Click the System Restore option. <br>
5.	Select the account. <br>
6.	Confirm your account password. <br>
7.	Click the Continue button. <br>
8.	Click the Next button. <br>
9.	Select the most recent restore point to resolve the blue screen error. <br>
 <br>
Figure 29 <br>
10.	Click the Scan for affected programs button to determine the apps that may be affected using a restore point. <br>
11.	Click the Close button. <br>
12.	Click the Next button. <br>
13.	Click the Finish button. <br>
Figure 30 <br>
After you complete the steps, the feature will undo updates, drivers, apps, and system changes done after the point of restoration was created, hopefully fixing the system crashes you're experiencing.
<br>
<h2>4.8 RESOLVE BSOD WITH SAFE MODE</h2> <br>
Windows 10 also provides "Safe mode," which is an environment that only starts the basic drivers and features enough to access the desktop to troubleshoot and resolve virtually any kind of issues, including system rashes.
You can access Safe mode using the advanced startup menu during boot or using a Windows 10 installation media. (Select one of the options below, and continue with the steps below.)
Advanced startup access from boot <br>
To launch the advanced startup settings to access Safe mode, use these steps: <br>
Step 1: Start your computer. <br>
<br>
Step 2: As soon as the Windows logo appears on your screen, press and hold the power button to interrupt the boot sequence.
Step 1: Repeat steps No. 1 and 2 two more times. <br>
After the third interruption, Windows 10 should open the advanced startup menu, and then you can continue with the steps below to access Safe mode.
<br>
After your computer reboots, press the F4 (or 4) key to select the Enable Safe Mode option.

<h2>4.8 FIRMWARE</h2> <br>
 Firmware is a specific class of computer software that provides the low-level control for a device's specific hardware. <br>	 
Firmware, such as the BIOS of a personal computer, may contain basic functions of a device, and may provide hardware abstraction services to higher-level software such as operating systems. For less complex devices, firmware may act as the device's complete operating system, performing all control, monitoring and data manipulation functions. Typical examples of devices containing firmware are embedded systems, home and personal-use appliances, computers, and computer peripherals.
Firmware is held in non-volatile memory devices such as ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, and Flash memory. Updating firmware requires ROM integrated circuits to be physically replaced, or EPROM or flash memory to be reprogrammed through a special procedure. Some firmware memory devices are permanently installed and cannot be changed after manufacture. Common reasons for updating firmware include fixing bugs or adding features to the device.
 <br>
 <h2>4.9 HOW TO FIX OR UPGRADE FIRMWARE </h2><br>
If your BIOS firmware has become corrupted, there are a few troubleshooting steps you can take to try to repair the corrupted BIOS. If your motherboard has backup BIOS, you can boot into the backup BIOS and reflash the corrupted BIOS. If your motherboard does not have backup BIOS, you may be able to replace the BIOS chip. However, in some cases, the only option may be to replace the motherboard entirely
<br>
Step 1: Boot from the backup BIOS (Gigabyte motherboards only). Some Gigabyte motherboards come with a backup BIOS installed on the motherboard. If the main BIOS is corrupted, you can boot from the backup BIOS, which will automatically reprogram the main BIOS if there is anything wrong with it.
<br>
Method 1: Power your computer off. Then press and hold the power button until your computer powers back on. Continue to hold the power button until the computer powers off again. When you power it back on, it should boot from the backup BIOS.
<br>
Step 3: Remove the dedicated graphics card. Some users have reported that problems with the BIOS can be fixed by removing the dedicated graphics card and connecting your PC to the integrated graphics card
 <br>
Figure 32 <br>
One of three ways to reset BIOS FIRMWARE: <br>
<br>
1.	Boot into the BIOS and reset it to the factory settings. If you are able to boot into the BIOS, go ahead and do so. Locate the option to "Load Setup Defaults", "Restore Factory Settings", or something similar. Select this option to reset the BIOS.
<br>
2.	Remove the CMOS battery from the motherboard. Unplug your computer and open your computer's case to access the motherboard. It's the large board that has all the cables, chips, and computer cards attached to it. Locate the CMOS battery. Generally, it is a type CR2032 battery that is about the size of a quarter. Carefully remove the battery and let it sit for 20 minutes. If your computer is a laptop, remove the laptop battery as well. If this doesn't fix the issue, try replacing the battery with a new one.
<br>
3.	Reset the jumper. This is typically done on older motherboards. Unplug your computer and open your computer's case to access the motherboard. Locate a jumper cable that says "CMOS" or something similar next to it. The jumper will be placed on two out of three pins. Remove the jumper and replace it one set of pins over. Press and hold the Power button on the computer for about 15 seconds. Replace the jumper back to it original position.
<br>
Devices That Use Firmware <br>
•	A lot of devices found in most people’s homes use firmware, including the items listed below. <br>
•	Personal Computers <br>

 A personal computer (PC)’s firmware components are just as important as its operating system (OS). But unlike an OS, firmware cannot update itself automatically to fix issues detected after the unit gets shipped.
Consumer Products Today’s portable music players like iPods get firmware upgrades. Some device manufacturers use firmware updates to add new playable file formats (codec). Other features that such updates may change include graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or battery life. Almost all mobile phones have a firmware over-the-air firmware upgrade capability these days.etc
  <br>
Figure 33 <br>
<h2>4.10 OPERATING SYSTEM MAINTENANCE</h2> <br>
An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
<br>
Step 1: Backup the Data Regularly <br>
A good backup is essential to deal with corruption situations. So backup the data regularly and save it to a secure location. It will be helpful in case the original data gets corrupt or get deleted somehow.
<br>
Step 2: It’s a good practice to check the health status of the hard disk regularly. For this, you can try Windows CHKDSK Tool or WMIC command. Both the methods are given below:
•	Method 1) Windows CHKDSK Tool <br>
Windows CHKDSK tool checks the bad sectors on the hard drive. It can scan for errors and fix them. Here are the steps required to run the tool. Select any drive of your drives and right-click on it. Then select Properties.
<br>
Figure 34 <br>
1.	Go to the Tools tab, click Check and then OK. <br>
Figure 35 <br>
2.	A dialogue box will notify you whether you need to run the scan or not. <br>
Figure 36 <br>

•	Step 3: Always keep a professional anti-virus program on your system. And keep updating it on regular basis.
Check Hard Disk Health Regularly <br>
3.	You can click Scan Drive and check any possible error. <br>
Figure 37 <br>

•	Windows recovery tool after corruption so as to recover the data at the earliest. Here are some tips to avoid Windows corruption and to save data:
<br>
Replace Old and Faulty Hardware Components <br>
•	Hardware components have to work properly for the normal functioning of the computer. But, like other things, hardware components get older and slower, and gradually stop working. Failure of hardware components can bring disastrous results as the computer will stop working. It can also cause system crashes and other performance issues. So it is quite essential to replace old and faulty hardware components.
Be Vigilant Against Virus Attacks <br>
•	Operating System files are always vulnerable to threats from malware, spyware, and viruses. You must follow some Dos and Don’ts while handling unknown links:

<h1>CHAPTER FIVE</h1> <br>
<h2>SUMMARY, CONCLUSION, AND RECOMMENDATION<br> <br>
5.1 SUMMARY</h2> <br>
THE Primary and main aim of this program is to expose students to a practice aspect of study and to some machines, equipment and other facilities that are not available in our various institution. I gain basic knowledge on the formation and assembly of computer system, this report states and describe different exercises that have been done and undergoes during my SIWES program which is ITF program. I have learned practical aspect of Reading reference designator (on PCB), schematic reading, method of operating basic Input Output System (BIOS), upgrading and maintaining Firmware, color code reading of DC entry of PC, different tools use in maintaining computer etc during my ITF program. 
The relevance of SIWES programme cannot be over emphasized considering the fact that  has significantly reduced the barrier gap of doubt regarding my theoretical and practical knowledge about computer hardware, software, installation, maintenance , repair and the process of replacing components, finding of electronic fault, trouble shooting and what diagnose is all about.
5.2 Conclusion</h2> <br>
I highly thank and commend Nigerian university commission, and other organization for implementing policy on this programme. Great thanks be for the formation of SIWES programme of which the practice helps students to acquire different know ledges toward different p\arts of their courses.
  The practice of SIWES programme which intend students to realize on different area of practical works which haven’t taught or teaches in the institution due to uncomplitable syllables or time scarce.
  As I undergoes on my IT service programme I entirely undergoes to various equipment materials, tools ,how to operate and disassemble and assemble different electronic  which offer the successful opportunity to learned, experience and interact with different expert, professional in the field of electronics maintenance.
The programme gave me the opportunity to realize on my chosen carriers on the field of computer engineering matters.
	I therefore concluded by thanking the SIWES and ITF officials in general, for their effort toward the student industrial work training scheme and for their contribution towards the creation of such program for the progress of different students who engage in high institution.
<br>
    <h2>5.3 RECOMMENDATION </h2> <br>
I do achieved and experience different types of knowledge, experienced and 
And of which I undergoes different problem strategy, and of which I recommend to my dear follows student to know how to maintain, care and prevent themselves on their own SIWES programme 	
To encourage some students that undergoes SIWES programme here are some of my recommendation that’s to be well considered by some of the IT students:
<br>
1.	ITF students should ensure and beware of reporting his or her experienced observation  achieved in his or her logbook  regularly to avoid miss-reporting 
<br>
2.	ITF officials should be ensure that, regular visitation is to be achieved, by supervising those student goes for their Industrial Training programmed regularly and at regular time.
<br>
3.	 Students goes for IT service most maintain their financial transport because there not allowances for the student, and even if there is optional for the employee to paid the IT students allowances or wages.
<br>
4.	Does Students that doesn’t have fixed accommodation should be aware of finding their own accommodation or place to stay till they end there student industrial work experience scheme (SIWES), because there is no accommodation been provided by the SIWES.
<br>
5.	The log books given by students for the attachment by the institution must be checked by the industrial supervisor and must be signed by the institution and Industrial training fund supervisors regularly at time not after the resumption of school.
